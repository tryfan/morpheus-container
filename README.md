# Morpheus in Docker

## Quickstart

If you have Docker or Docker desktop installed on your machine, you can do the following to create a Morpheus environment:

- Clone this repo
- `cd morpheus-container/examples`
- `docker-compose up -d`
- In as little as 18 minutes, depending on system and internet connection speed, setup Morpheus at `https://localhost`

## Usage

There is a sample `docker-compose.yml` in `examples/`.  This will work if you are running docker on your desktop.  Morpheus will be accessible at `https://localhost`.  Data will be stored in the directories in `examples/` and seems to take up about 4GB.  

If you are running this on a docker host on another machine, replace `https://localhost` with `https://<IP of the docker host>`.  If you want the data directories outside `examples/` for a more permanent setup, replace the data volume directories in `docker-compose.yml`.  The configured healthchecks will start up everything in order with `docker-compose up -d`.

If you are having trouble with one or more services starting up, you can try `docker-compose up -d es mysql rmq guacd` and confirm a good startup on those before starting the Morpheus container with: `docker-compose up -d morpheus`

The example also contains what we think are sane minimums for a dev container of Morpheus.  The total RAM usage for the docker host and containers seems to be just over 6GB.

## Tags

Tags will match the Morpheus version, as well as a `latest` for the latest standard Morpheus version, and `latest-lts` will point to the latest LTS release.

## Building

Build the container:

`docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t morpheus:latest "."`

## Configuration

Supported configuration entries for morpheus.rb are translated and processed through environment variables.  So, `rabbitmq['queue_user']` becomes `MORPHEUS_RABBITMQ_QUEUE_USER`.  `make-morpheus-rb.sh` has the full list of supported variables.
